# JavaFX-Tetris

Description: A remake of the classic 1984 game "Tetris", in which a player will try to place falling blocks so they fill up rows and make the blocks disappear fast enough to avoid them reaching the top of the screen and ending the game. The player can rotate pieces using the "R" key and move blocks left and right using the "A" and "D" keys.
